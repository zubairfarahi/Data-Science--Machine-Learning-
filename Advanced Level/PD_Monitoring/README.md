### Description

In the treatment of various neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson's Disease - PD, Multiple Sclerosis - MS, Stroke Recovery) it is important to extend monitoring capabilities beyond the clinical visits to enable continuous assessment of disease progression / regression. Within the context of the ALAMEDA project remote monitoring of patients is proposed, whereby objective data (from wearables such as smart watches, smart insoles and smart bracelets), as well as subjective patient reported data (e.g. questionnaires for mental state, emotional state and limitations in performing activities of daily living). The objective of this research topic is to evaluate the capability of patient acquired data from the above mentioned modalities to predict the result of future standardized medical tests that assess disease state. The challenge of the topic lies in analyzing multiple and variable frequency (from hourly, to monthly entries) time series containing both numeric and categorical data.
