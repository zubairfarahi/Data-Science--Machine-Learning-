# Data Science (Machine Learning)


This is my personal machine learning notebook, used primarily for references and sharing what I learned recently.

The source of the content primarily comes from courses I took from Stanford, i.e. CS229, CS231n and CS224n and many other research papers, textbooks and online tutorials. There are also notes I took from my professional work and personal projects using machine learning.

## Table of Contents

The list is not sorted in any order.



The list is certainly expanding as I take new classes and learn new things from work.

## Latex Usage

Jupyter notebook uses single dollar sign for inline equations but GitBook uses double dollar sign
for inline equations. I need a RegExp that capture and convert.
